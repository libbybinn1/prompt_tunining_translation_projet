Prologue He stood there before him
The closet is decorated with a few flowers and around it. (וסביבו)
A small number of other people (יתר)
The crowd had not yet come. (לבוא)
His right hand was behind me. (מאחורי)
His back grips his elbow.
The other hand released his eyes red (אדומות)
He's torn wide and he's silent. (שתיקה)
Shocked. Shocked. He can't believe it. (מאמין)
That it happened to him. That's Lenir.
Neer was the kind of person who should (שאמורים)
Retire with physical fitness. (גופני)
Great and a family that has (כדי)
To boast of death at twenty-one (ואחת)
It wasn't really his style. (ממש)
No. He bit his lips.
Nick and he were close friends. (קרובים)
To say goodbye at such an early stage. (מוקדם)
Someone stood behind him.
Shay turned sharply It was
His lips are quivering shih he
Whispered and pulled in his nose and they hugged (התחבקו)
Prolonged from then until the end of the ceremony (טקס)
The funeral was finally over. (נשארו)
There are only the parents and a few of my sons. (בני)
Family Shai leaned over and picked up a stone
A small gravel he picked up (את)
His eyes to Erez as pain cries out (זועק)
Taken from them twenty-one noted
Concrete that tried to be dry young
He agreed with him in a hoarse voice. (צרוד)
Shay nodded his head slowly and after (ואחר)
Bend over and place the stone on (על)
The main thing is that the soil is fresh. (שהוא)
Managed to escape Erez's voice (ארז)
Vibrating Shih raised a look at him (מבט)
Penetrating as hair is not
Vibrating from weeping but from conquered rage (כבוש)
You mean the driver tried to find out (לברר)
Just be careful who is packing. (ארז)
Was as a step before a nervous breakdown (עצבים)
